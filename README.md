# Search Engine

> I built a movie search app using React that lets users search for movies in real time with the TMDB API. The app features a debounced search bar (so it doesn’t overload the API while you type), a loading spinner, error handling, and a grid of movie cards showing posters, ratings, languages, and release years.

<br>

> I split the UI into ***components*** like Search for the input, MovieCard for each movie’s details, and Spinner for loading states. I used ***state*** to manage the search term, loading, errors, and the list of movies. ***Props*** are passed down to keep everything in sync between components. I also integrated Appwrite as a backend to fetch trending movies, so users can see what’s popular.
